		<p>I only find within my bones
			A taste for eating earth and stones.
			When I feed, I feed on air,
			Rocks and coals and iron ore.

			My hunger, turn. Hunger, feed,
			A field of bran.
			Gather as you can the bright
			Poison weed.

			Eat the rocks a beggar breaks,
			The stones of ancient churches' walls;
			Pebbles, children of the flood,
			Loaves left lying in the mud.
			Beneath the bush a wolf will howl
			Spitting bright feathers
			From his feast of fowl:
			Like him, I devour myself.
